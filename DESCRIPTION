Description: 
    The following modules are included in the package: 
    Adaptive designs with data-driven sample size or event count re-estimation, 
    Adaptive designs with data-driven treatment selection, 
    Adaptive designs with data-driven population selection, 
    Optimal selection of a futility stopping rule, 
    Event prediction in event-driven trials,
    Adaptive trials with response-adaptive randomization (experimental module), 
    Traditional trials with multiple objectives (experimental module).
