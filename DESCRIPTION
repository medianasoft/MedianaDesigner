Description:
  Efficient simulation-based power and sample size calculations are supported for a
  broad class of late-stage clinical trials. The following modules are included in
  the package:
  Adaptive designs with data-driven sample size or event count re-estimation,
  Adaptive designs with data-driven treatment selection,
  Adaptive designs with data-driven population selection,
  Optimal selection of a futility stopping rule,
  Event prediction in event-driven trials,
  Adaptive trials with response-adaptive randomization (experimental module),
  Traditional trials with multiple objectives (experimental module).
  Traditional trials with cluster-randomized designs (experimental module).
