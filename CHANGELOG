2021-02-22 Version 0.1
First release of the package with the initial implementation of five modules:
- Adaptive designs with data-driven sample size or event count re-estimation (ADSSMod function).
- Adaptive designs with data-driven treatment selection (ADTreatSel function).
- Adaptive designs with data-driven population selection (ADPopSel function).
- Optimal selection of a futility stopping rule (FutRule function).
- Event prediction in event-driven trials (EventPred function).

Fixed minor bugs and added the following features:
- Enabled 100% test coverage
- Added the "direction" parameter (direction of favorable outcome) to the ADSSMod, ADTreatSel, ADPopSel and FutRule functions 

2021-08-15 Version 0.2.3
Fixed minor bugs and added the following module:
- Experimental module for designing trials with response-adaptive randomization (ADRand function)

2021-09-20 Version 0.3
