2021-02-22 Version 0.1
First release of the package with the initial implementation of five modules:
- Adaptive designs with data-driven sample size or event count re-estimation (ADSSMod function).
- Adaptive designs with data-driven treatment selection (ADTreatSel function).
- Adaptive designs with data-driven population selection (ADPopSel function).
- Optimal selection of a futility stopping rule (FutRule function).
- Event prediction in event-driven trials (EventPred function).
